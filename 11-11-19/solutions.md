# Code explanation

*Longest common subsequence*

We use a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the lcs of each substring of the given strings. Complexity is O(n*m).

*0-1 knapsack*

Again we use the dynamic programming approach, in particular weight dynamic programming. Complexity is O(C*n) (pseudo-polynomial), where C is the capacity of the knapsack.
